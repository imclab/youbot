- Update the corpus with new tweets periodically. You can go back up to 3,200 tweets in the past with the API
- Add a way to pick the funny tweets before they go out
- Add functionality such that it generates a lot of tweets at once, and uses those in the twitter bot (since generating them is quite resource-intensive, but tweeting isn't)
- Remove email addresses from corpus
